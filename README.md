## 最新动向

- [2022.7.20] In order to reduce duplication of work and focus on subsequent development and maintenance work, **Follow-up EISeg will only be available in the official PaddlePaddle repository [PaddlePaddle/PaddeSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg /tree/release/2.6/EISeg), the existing code repository will no longer be updated**. Thank you very much for your company and support along the way. EISeg will wholeheartedly provide you with more and better annotation functions. You are welcome to experience it at the new address, and I hope you will continue to support us.
